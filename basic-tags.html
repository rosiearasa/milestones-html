<h2>The Illiad of Homer:Book I</h2>
<li>The Paragraph Tag
<p>“Help your brave son, therefore, if you are able. Go to Olympus, and if you have ever done him service in word or deed, implore the aid of Jove. Ofttimes in my father’s house have I heard you glory in that you alone of the immortals saved the son of Saturn from ruin, when the others, with Juno, Neptune, and Pallas Minerva would have put him in bonds. It was you, goddess, who delivered him by calling to Olympus the hundred-handed monster whom gods call Briareus, but men Aegaeon, for he is stronger even than his father; when therefore he took his seat all-glorious beside the son of Saturn, the other gods were afraid, and did not bind him. Go, then, to him, remind him of all this,
  clasp his knees, and bid him give succour to the Trojans. Let the Achaeans be hemmed in at the sterns of their ships, and perish on the sea-shore, that they may reap what joy they may of their king, and that Agamemnon may rue his blindness in offering
   insult to the foremost of the Achaeans.”

  Minerva was not slack to do her bidding. Down she darted from the topmost summits
  of Olympus, and in a moment she was at the ships of the Achaeans.
  here she found Ulysses, peer of Jove in counsel, standing alone.
   He had not as yet laid a hand upon his ship, for he was grieved and sorry; so she went close up to him and said, “Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, are you going to fling yourselves into your ships and be off home to your own land in this way? Will you leave Priam and the Trojans the glory of still keeping Helen, for whose sake so many of the Achaeans have died at Troy, far from their homes?
   Go about at once among the host, and speak fairly to them, man by man, that they draw not their ships into the sea.”

  Thus they prayed, but not as yet would Jove grant them their prayer.
  Then Priam, descendant of Dardanus, spoke, saying, “Hear me, Trojans and Achaeans, I will now go back to the wind-beaten city of Ilius: I dare not with my own eyes witness this fight between my son and Menelaus,
  for Jove and the other immortals alone know which shall fall.”

<em>
  Then she went to call Helen, and found her on a high tower with the Trojan women crowding round her.
   She took the form of an old woman who used to dress wool for her when she was still in Lacedaemon, and of whom she was very fond.</em>
    Thus disguised she plucked her by perfumed robe and said,<i>“Come hither; Alexandrus says you are to go to the house;
     he is on his bed in his own room, radiant with beauty and dressed in gorgeous apparel.
   No one would think he had just come from fighting, but rather that he was going to a dance, or had done dancing and was sitting down.”</i>
  With these words she moved the heart of Helen to anger.
   When she marked the beautiful neck of the goddess, her lovely bosom, and sparkling eyes, she marvelled at her and said,<i>“Goddess, why do you thus beguile me?
    Are you going to send me afield still further to some man whom you have taken up in Phrygia or fair Meonia?
     Menelaus has just vanquished Alexandrus, and is to take my hateful self back with him.
     You are come here to betray me. Go sit with Alexandrus yourself; henceforth be goddess no longer; never let your feet carry you back to Olympus;
      worry about him and look after him till he make you his wife, or, for the matter of that, his slave—but me?
      I shall not go; I can garnish his bed no longer; I should be a by-word among all the women of Troy.
   Besides, I have trouble on my mind.”</i>

<strong>
  Now the gods were sitting with Jove in council upon the golden floor while Hebe went round pouring out nectar for them to drink,
  and as they pledged one another in their cups of gold they looked down upon the town of Troy. The son of Saturn then began to tease Juno,
   talking at her so as to provoke her.</strong>
   <b>“Menelaus,” said he, “has two good friends among the goddesses, Juno of Argos, and Minerva of Alalcomene, but they only sit still and look on,
     while Venus keeps ever by Alexandrus’ side to defend him in any danger; indeed she has just
     rescued him when he made sure that it was all over with him—for the victory really did lie with Menelaus.
      We must consider what we shall do about all this; shall we set them fighting anew or make peace between them?
   If you will agree to this last Menelaus can take back Helen and the city of Priam may remain still inhabited.”</b>

  And now no man would have made light of the fighting if he could have gone about among it scatheless and unwounded,
  with Minerva leading him by the hand, and protecting him from the storm of spears and arrows.
  For many Trojans and Achaeans on that day lay stretched side by side face downwards upon the earth. An this html file without a <code>button</code> or any CSS styles such as
  <code>background color</code> was written to document that day.
